Core Requirements:
- You should be able to play against the computer.
- Explain your algorithm for win detection (don't just hard code winning patterns).
- You should be able to pick who is the computer player and who is the human player.
- The application should run in the terminal only (no web interface)
- The computer does not need to be smart.  Randomly selecting an available space is fine.
- When the game is done, it should announce who the winner is and ask if you want to play again.
- The application should be built using object oriented design.


Suggestions:
- Make the grid size variable
- Keep your code DRY
- Feel free to show off
- Test it using RSpec or MiniTest
- Make the computer player smart
- Randomize who gets the first turn between computer and human players
